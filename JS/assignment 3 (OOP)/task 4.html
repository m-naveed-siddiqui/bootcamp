    <h2>Task 4:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a Bank Account class with attributes accountId , accountTitle, balance, emailID. Make each variable private. Initialize all the attributes and make them private. Make settes(mutators) and getters(accessors) for all the variables. Now make a method withdrawAmount(amount) and depositAmount(amount). Each will have a parameter of some amount. For withdrawAmount() display user the amount that has been withdrawn and remaining balance . Make sure that amount that is being withdrawn is not greater than the balance. For depositAmount() add the amount and show the current balance.</li>
