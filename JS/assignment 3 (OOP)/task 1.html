    <h2>Task 1:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In this task we provide you with the start of a definition for a Shape class. It has three properties: name, sides, and side Length. This class only models shape for which all sides are the same length, like a square or an equilateral triangle.</li>
        <li>Add a constructor to this class. The constructor takes arguments for the name, sides, and sideLength properties, and initializes them.</li>
        <li>Add a new method calcPerimeter() method to the class, which calculates its perimeter (the length of the shape's outer edge) and logs the result to the console. </li>
        <li>Create a new instance of the Shape class called square. Give it a name of square and a sideLength of 5.</li>
        <li>Call your calcPerimeter() method on the instance, to see whether it logs the calculation result to the browser's console as expected.</li>
        <li>Create a new instance of Shape called triangle, with a name of triangle and a sideLength of 3.</li>
        <li>Call triangle.calcPerimeter() to check that it works OK.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>See Answer in console:</h2>

    <script>
        let { log } = console;

        class Shape {
            name;
            sides;
            side_length;
            constructor(name, sides, side_length) {
                this.name = name;
                this.sides = sides;
                this.side_length = side_length;    
            }
            calcPerimeter() {
                let length = this.sides*this.side_length;
                log(length);
            }
        }

        let square = new Shape('Square', 4, 5);
        let triangle = new Shape('Triangle', 3, 3);

        square.calcPerimeter();
        triangle.calcPerimeter();
